# on_the_drawing_board
This project is a recent mock up of a one page web app for a potential client. I used Ruby on Rails, a considerable amount of CSS, Javascript, & Jquery through a template, some HTML, and bootstrap. This project was mostly front-end design & development, but I also spent time consulting with the client on UX/UI and discussing their needs moving forward. The result was a full time offer, but it was not a good fit, and I declined.

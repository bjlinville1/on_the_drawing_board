# on_the_drawing_board
This project is a mock up of a one page web app for demonstration purposes. I used Ruby on Rails, a considerable amount of CSS, Javascript, & Jquery through a template, some HTML, and bootstrap. This project was mostly front-end design & development, but I also spent time consulting on UX/UI.
